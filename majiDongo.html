            <h1>Maji Ndogo Analysis</h1>
            <h2 class="section-title">1. Introduction and Overview</h2>
            <p>The Maji Ndogo project represents a comprehensive initiative aimed at addressing water access and infrastructure challenges in the village of Maji Ndogo. With a database containing over 60,000 records, this ongoing project utilizes SQL, Power BI, and Python to extract insights, develop solutions, and drive actionable outcomes.

                Divided into four stages of exploratory data analysis, the project seeks to answer key questions. Here are a few sample questions asked:

               <ol> What are the types and conditions of existing water sources?</ol>
              <ol> How frequently are these water sources visited, and what is their distribution across the village?</ol> 
              <ol>  What is the quality of water sources, and are there any pollution issues that need immediate attention?</ol>
            <ol>How can we optimize infrastructure maintenance and address resource allocation challenges to ensure sustainable water access for the community? </ol>
            <ol>Through a systematic approach to data analysis and visualization, the Maji Ndogo project aims to inform decision-making, improve resource allocation, and ultimately enhance the quality of life for residents.</ol>



                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">2. Analysis</h2>
            <p>To show the analysis conducted on this data, I will show a few SQL code snippets and share the insights acquired
               <ol> The first and second code snippets show some code that demonstrates the type of water sources, number of people served, water quality and time in queue by town name and province name. </ol>
                <ol>The third and fourth snippets show the code written to find contaminated sources and update them with proper description.</ol>
                <ol>The fifth snippet is used to update the time format so as to analyze the time spent in queues as well as busy days.</ol>


                This analysis will allow the decision makers to find the provinces and towns with poor quality infrastructure and places that have the longest queue times and more analysis is done to find why this is the case for certain parts of Maji Ndogo.

                This will allow them to identify the main places to allocate resources and conduct infrastructure maintenance.

            <div class="visualization">
                <h3>3. Power BI Visualizations</h3>
                Visualizations are created to better present the insights uncovered in an interactive way. A few visualizations are shared here:

            <ol>a. The first visualization is about the queue times for water access in Maji Ndogo, distributed by gender and days of the week.</ol>

            <img src="images/MD 1.png" alt="">
            <ol>
                b. The second visualization was about analysis into the crime situation of Maji Ndogo.
                </ol>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>NB:</strong>  The current stage of the Maji Ndogo project is the automation of their agriculture processes using Python and its extensive libraries namely pandas, numpy and matplotlib. There will be more advanced machine learning applications within this project.</p>
        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2 class="section-title">4. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In conclusion, the Maji Ndogo project represents a comprehensive effort to address water access and infrastructure challenges in the village of Maji Ndogo. Through stages of exploratory data analysis using SQL, Power BI visualizations, and ongoing automation of agriculture processes using Python, the project aims to extract insights, develop solutions, and drive actionable outcomes. By systematically analyzing water source types, visit frequency, water quality, pollution issues, and infrastructure maintenance needs, the project endeavors to inform decision-making, improve resource allocation, and enhance the quality of life for residents. As the project continues to evolve, it holds the potential to drive sustainable development and foster positive change in the community.
